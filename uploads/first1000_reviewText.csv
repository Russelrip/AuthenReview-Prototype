review_text
I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.
"This book is a reissue of an old one; the author was born in 1910. It's of the era of, say, Nero Wolfe. The introduction was quite interesting, explaining who the author was and why he's been forgotten; I'd never heard of him.The language is a little dated at times, like calling a gun a &#34;heater.&#34;  I also made good use of my Fire's dictionary to look up words like &#34;deshabille&#34; and &#34;Canarsie.&#34; Still, it was well worth a look-see."
"This was a fairly interesting read.  It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get  to read a story that doesn't have coarse, crasslanguage.  I read for fun and relaxation......I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing,innovative, and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language."
I'd never read any of the Amy Brewster mysteries until this one..  So I am really hooked on them now.
"If you like period pieces - clothing, lingo, you will enjoy this mystery.  Author had me guessing at least 2/3 of the way through."
A beautiful in-depth character description makes it like a fast pacing movie. It is a pity Mr Merwin did not write 30 instead only 3 of the Amy Brewster mysteries.
"I enjoyed this one tho I'm not sure why it's called An Amy Brewster Mystery as she's not in it very much. It was clean, well written and the characters well drawn."
"Never heard of Amy Brewster. But I don't need to like Amy Brewster to like this book. Actually, Amy Brewster is a side kick in this story, who added mystery to the story not the one resolved it. The story brings back the old times, simple life, simple people and straight relationships."
Darth Maul working under cloak of darkness committing sabotage now that is a story worth reading many times over.  Great story.
"This is a short story focused on Darth Maul's role in helping the Trade Federation gain a mining colony. It's not bad, but it's also nothing exceptional. It's fairly short so we don't really get to see any characters develop. The few events that do happen seem to go by quickly, including what should have been major battles. The story is included in the novelShadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul), which is worth reading, so don't bother to buy this one separately."
I think I have this one in both book and audio. It is a good story either way. good ol' Maul.
Title has nothing to do with the story.  I did enjoy it though.  Good short story about Darth Maul setting up two corporations against each other.  All in the end to help Darth Sidious' rise to power.  Won't take you long to read & it's cheap.  Go for it.
Well written. Interesting to see Sideous (through Maul) maneuvering events to fit his plan. We see human nature at work. But no good guys to root for. Even Rurit is a helpless pawn.
"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters."
"I am not for sure on how much of a difference the short story has on the overall series (I haven't read on yet), but I would recommend that anyone buy it to help them understand the whole series better.P.S.- The series is one of the best of all the Star Wars series."
I really enjoyed the book. Had the normal back against the wall moments. It even had laugh out loud moments.
Great read enjoyed every minute of it .  I think it answers some questions that are out there about this series.
"Another well written eBook by Troy Denning, but why is it put where it is? Why not a part of Balance Point? It is well written and belongs in the new Jedi Order. I just don't think it should stand alone. It is fun and fast to read on my Kindle, but not even in paperback????"
This one promises to be another good book. I have been reading through the series and have not gotten this far yet.
"I have a version of ""Star by Star"" that does not include the novella ""Recovery,"" so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  ""Recovery"" tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in ""Balance Point.""  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship, it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out, like in the DVD's, where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it, but probably not to everyone."
"Excellent! Very well written story, very exciting with LOTS of action. The bad guys trying to kill Leia and Han. Viki Shesh is introduced."
"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more."
Great book couldn't put it down.  The story expands events in the new Jedi order series.  Good writer in Walter Jon Williams.
"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids, to the extent that some are viewed as ""Jacen books"" or ""Jania books."" The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
I was hoping to find this one in book form. The story looks like it will be good when I get that far in the series.
"The events of ""Ylesia"" take place during ""Destiny's Way.""  If you've read ""Destiny's Way,"" you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there, it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.""Ylesia"" doesn't advance ""Destiny's Way"" or ""The New Jedi Order"" in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it, I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF, ""Ylesia"" is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google, you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there."
"Really shouldn't have Han Solo on the cover as he doesn't come into the story.This story is all about Chewbacca and his family.I won't give anything away, but it is a nice, if short, read."
"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion."
This book was a good idea. I have always wanted to read more about Chewbaccas son Lumpy. Though I do wish he would have added more to the ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Star Wars and Chewbacca.
"Great short story. It gives a little more insight into the walking carpet we all love, this time as a father"
I love anything with Chewbacca in it.  Him and his family is just a bonus.  Kind of nice to see him having problems with his son.
"A great little chapter to read on my Kindle, but not necessarily worth the price. It would have been a nice addition to The Courtship of Princess Leia or an add on to Tatooine Ghost. I liked it, but when it doesn't even rate being published as a paperback; an avid Star Wars fan you will need to be to download and read this eBook."
I love the stories with Chewie in them! this e-book is no exception. great character introductions and wonderful story line.
I'm not really sure where it actually fits into the overall story line.This story involves only Chewie and his wife and son.  The other characters are only mentioned in passing.  It was enjoyable and well written but I was glad it was very short and didn't keep me from the main story for very long.
"I really do enjoy Troy Denning's work, I want everyone who reads this review to know this.  I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.  I did like seeing that even in a galaxy far far away that we have sons who want to be like their fathers and get into trouble when they do rebellious things.  This story reminded me of what a good writer Troy Denning is and it reminded me to add his other works to my wishlist.Check this one out!"
"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars)."
"Not too bad, an intro-short-story for some bigger upcoming novel. It's timothy Zahn, what did you expect from the master of Science Fiction."
I absolutely love this book. Though it is short it was written by Zahn. Any Star Wars fan knows this book is a good one. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Star Wars.
What can I say Stormtroopers.  A story with troopers is as awesome as a story with any Sith lord.  AWESOME!!!!!!
"For whatever reason, Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The ""Tales of..."" are great in that they explain background characters. However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist. Also, just to note, this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars), so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
"As an ebook it reads very well on my Kindle, but it really doesn't seem to belong where it is. Maybe at the end of The Dark Nest Trilogy or Legacy of the Force, but it just seems not to have a place it belongs in the Star Wars universe. At least not to me."
"** Note: this story appears as a bonus in the paperback edition of Survivor's Quest. **Fool's Bargain is a short story featuring the stormtroopers of Aurek-Four, a unit of the Imperial 501st Legion of the Empire of the Hand.  It takes place shortly before the events of Survivor's Quest, but is probably best read after.The Empire of the Hand is involved in a war to rid the native Eickarie people of their latest warlord, but the 501st curious orders are very specific - take the warlord alive.  This story is tightly focused, with a couple of characters firmly at the center.  There's good detail here but for some reason it doesn't feel as well developed as other short stories I've read by Zahn.  Also,  those who look for big names in their Star Wars stories will want to give this a pass.  A couple of minor characters from Survivor's Quest show up in largely supporting roles, but there are no movie characters nor beloved favorites here.But despite these caveats Fool's Bargain is a good short story that gives further glimpse of Zahn's take on stormtroopers, which he touched on in Survivor's Quest, and would continue to explore in later novels (Allegiance and Choices of One)."
"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me."
"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.  Any fan of Star Wars or Zahn's writing will enjoy this book very much!"
"The hero in this story has been living in NYC and working for a sort of Crime boss.  Beaten up and tossed in an empty train car by the competition, he ends up out west and, by a series of flukes, becomes the sheriff of a small western town that is in serious trouble.  While it is not one of my L'Amour favorites, he tells it with his usual flair and attention to detail and it's well worth reading."
"The Iron Marshall, by Louie L`Amour is one of his best. Of course all of his are the best.Louie is a man who knew the west. His books make it possible to really feel how it was."
This is yet another  L'Amour winner. I have yet to read a book of his that was less than great. He has the ability to keep you enthalled enough in the story to make you not want to put the book down until it is finished.
I almost didn't get this book because of the cover but since it was double 'LL  I did.  As always the author came through.  Good book and characters.  The plot was interesting
"This story by Louis L'Amour was the very first of his novels that I ever read.  Novels with a western theme were not my thing when I was growning up, so imagine my surprise when I just sort of drifted into this book one rainy afternoon.  I guess I was attracted to it by the fact that it opens in New York City, not the deserts of New Mexico.Anyway, I soon found that L'Amour has a writing style just as smooth as silk, and I found myself sliding into this book as easily as if he took me by the hand and led me to an alter.  Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.  Others have outlined the text already, so I won't bore you with yet another outline.  I'll just say that if you have not read any of Louis L'Amour in the past, this would be a really great place to start, or even to get reacquainted.  While you do that, I'm gonna find another L'Amour book to read.:)"
"This is how it was in the big gambling and corrupt cities of the eastern seaboard.  Then go out west and become a real hero.  Again, the video was also good."
"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice, from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ, imo, is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP, according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf, but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap, or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book, and avoid the Kindle."
"simply stated and translated, this copy is easily understood. The review says it has to have eleven more words to be accepted, so here they are."
I have several translations of the Yoga Sutras and did find this one a fairly understandable one. It has a decent layout and you can move through it fairly fast.
"Did not impress me that much, as I have read the one written by The Yogaville founder (which was detailed and informative)"
As an aspiring yogini this is required reading.  It's not an easy read but it's essential and the translation was good.
"I thought it would be instructive to compare this Charles Johnston translation, sutra by sutra, to Chip Hartranft's Shambhala version of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.  I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work."
"L'Amour's story of a man whose wife has killed herself before a band of thieves and thugs can rape and murder her, keeps your interest from the first.  Brionne's concern with his son, traumatized by witnessing his mother's attack and death, and his attempt to help a young woman in distress take him to wild country where the same band of outlaws are trying to kill him, his son, the young woman, and anyone else traveling with him.  A good story."
I like most of Louis L'Amour's books and this is one is no exception. You want 6 more words. words words words words words words.
"Typical book by Louis L'Amour one of the best you can read as you read it seems that you are riding the trail along the side of the stories character,  you see what he sees, you hear what he hears . Can't go wrong with this author."
"BRIONNE is another one of L Amours great books. Imagine how it would be to see the mountains, and canyons and desserts. What we see in the lower fourth eight, is nothing compared to back when they drove the golden spike when the railroads joined. However it is an awful lot like here in Alaska."
"I enjoyed the book, I dislike reviewing L'Aour's books because I haven't found one I did not like.He writes about the part of the country I love and of course I love westerns also.  In this book, as wellas others he has written it is a good cast of characters and the story line is easy to follow.I could write mnore but then I would be into the book.  Good read."
"I needed an evening of relaxed reading, settling in with an old friend whose story I'd already heard, so I picked up Louis L'Amour's Brionne.  L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past."
L'Among classic.  Great read. Great book . Great on the MY Kendle. . . . . . . . ..
"I look forward to getting to the next books, and sometimes can't recall exactly what the book was about, but it is a very good book, and real good reading.'"
"He had an english accent which he seemed trying to hide. I don't know this, but my impression is that europeons now own the WSJ.England s a great country, but I'm suspicious of europeon socialism. (I really can't spell it.) In particular the Brits are proud of their writing ability, and rightly so, but I'd rather have Americans brainwashing Americans, bad as that may be."
"Somewhat of a disappointment.  The articles were all there, but I missed Pepper and Salt and the list of declared dividends, currency exchange, weather.  These were the small things that I would like for travel, the whole stack of paperes was waiting for me at home.  This was just a stop-gap for travel abroad where the WSJ was not available."
1. Costs more than delivered to your door paper and online version combined.2. Very confusing to read. Not intuitive.3. Layout is a nightmare4. Cant find anything like in the paper or online version.5. Price went up even more.I cancelled until they get it right just like everyone else who has tried it. Big let down.
"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced, and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out.  I have read and subscribed by Kindle, print edition, and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile).  Unfortunately, they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them.  10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold, and then when you try to cancel, it is abysmal.  More waiting.  I will never be part of WSJ Online, pinrt, Mobile or Kindle after my recent experiences.  Again, the company has been bought out and is now on its way out.  Beware."
"Although WSJ has good reporting and covers all the news, the price keeps going up.  I often buy alternatives due to the inflated price.  I don't think the Kindle version of WSJ is that much better than other sources of financial news (Financial Times, for example) to justify the price difference."
"I've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years, but had never really considered subscribing to it. For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read."
"This is it, the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles, no emailing articles to a friend, no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So, if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
"I read nearly all my books and magazines on Kindle.  I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.  I suppose I'll have to change my email -"
"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.  I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update: I have canceled my subscription."
"ten days into my trial subscription and i have decided to cancel. have read the wsj for 30 years and i guess i have one foot in the digital world and one in the analog world.i won't repeat all of the other comments, i can concur on the difficulties of making the transition to kindle reading. if i was still in a job that had me traveling alot it might make sense but since i pick up my wsj of my front porch it just doesn't work.the one thing that really baffles me is how to cancel a free trial. unless the magic button is hiding right out in the open, i can't find a website or kindle method to cancel. i had to call into customer service and yes, it got taken care of but i was disconnected three times before i made it into the queue, the fidelity of the call made it almost impossible to understand what the person was saying, and the english of the rep was spotty at best. not up to the usual amazon quality."
Always love to get this newspaper in my Kindle. I really enjoy the insightful opinion pieces. Quick read on the days headlines and how they apply to us non financial types. Please enjoy. I know I do.
This paper costs a lot per online issue but there's lots of good content.I'd like to choose what region to download from.  Maybe there's some way to do that but I always get the NYC version.Good newspaper.
"My Combination Online/Print version of the WSJ cost $160 per year.  The kindle version alone will run me $180 per year.  I might buy single issues for .99 a day on vacation but otherwise, I guess I'll keep filling up the landfills.  At the old $100 per year I would have switched.  Amazon...are you listening???"
"When it comes to speed and convenience, there is no better way to read the Wall Street Journal. With almost no advertisements, you just get the articles and pictures in a very concise and easy to read format. With wireless delivery, you get the paper delivered to your Kindle, no matter where you are, as soon as it comes out.I can't say enough how much I enjoy this version of the Wall Street Journal. With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me, whenever I'm looking for something to read.  Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one.  In the ""Page One"" section of the paper, it has several ""What's News"" blurbs, after the first couple articles.  While this is useful on the print version, it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle.  You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper, with a link to get to them.  Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.  I really wish that they would get rid of these ""article teaser links"", but in the mean time, I'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall, I really love the WSJ on my Kindle.  I highly recommend you get it in this format.  Good luck when you cancel your paper version, though, as they'll keep delivering it to you long after you cancel (so they can keep reporting you as a reader to their advertisers).  Magazines and newspapers are the best thing about Kindle."
I downloaded to read while sitting at the ocean!  Something cool about reading the journal and being at the beach!  I like their articles!
"i thought the n.y. times was a morning daily.  i'm on the west coast.  in new york, it's nearly noon.  i haven't received today's paper yet.  i left wireless on all night, and have been reading other kindle content all morning.  is this standard?"
"The 2 month free trial is well worth a try.  I'll say that up front.Second, NYT is a great paper.  I haven't gotten newspapers in a while, due wanting to cut down on the amount of trash I generate, and because I got tired of excessive advertising.  Blah, blah, blah .... now that I'm getting NYT as a wake up each morning, I'm remembering what I was missing.I'm spending 20 minutes per morning reading through the parts I find interesting.  It's good stuff.  I'll probably continue after the trial is over.That said, I agree that that price is a tad high.  I'd be much more comfortable with less than $20 per month, considering how much is stripped out.Also... someone at NYT should read these before they go out.  The Bridge column last week made numerous references to the missing diagram.  I can understand leaving out some pictures, but vital pictures should never be left out.  If you're going to leave out pictures, I think all the static Op-ed pictures can be left out.  The bridge column without diagrams is pointless, so it should be added to items to strip out -- or to include diagrams with.Good science section so far.  I miss the crossword.  Even if the crossword wasn't interactive, I'd love to see it.  I have some grid paper.NYT is really close here, I think, so with a little more care, they could have something less frustrating to send out.----------------------I've decided to continue subscribing.  I've been reading NYT in bed before getting up for awhile now, and it's a great way to start the day.  I'd still like for it to be better, but reading the newspaper in bed in the early morning is a new joy I don't want to give up."
"The NYT is way over-rated. Just a few examples. On their first page, they talked about saving the nation's energy by painting roofs white. Any white paint? No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article. My tone was reserved and systematic. The subject was the blocking of medical innovation by the medical bureaucracy and government. (FDA) GUESS WHAT? tHE COMMENT WAS ERASED. They evidently censor comments they don't agree with, or that may offend their advertisers. Is this the kind of society you want? You may not agree with me, but do you want to shut up those you  disagree with? Hint: You could be next.So my objections to the NYT are ethical and moral. Unfortunately, they have become government hacks rather than responsible journalists."
There is so much information packed into each daily issue that I just don't have time to read it all and read my other books and kindle magazines too. All the news that makes the New York Times such a great newspaper is included in the Kindle edition minus the ads. If you have time to read it daily it is well worth the $19.99 monthly subscription price.
"I am a big fan of the NY Times and see it as one of the top newspapers in the U.S.  One: $19.99 for the Kindle download covers every edition for the month.  Okay, say you miss looking at it for a day or two, that is still an excellent price.  You don't have time to read it all, no problem.  The fact is this is an everyday download.  Well worth the price.  Two, and listen up, you also get access to the NY Times on their homepage giving you the articles and the opportunity of email letters sent to your box which outline the major stories of the day, just in case your life has been particularly busy.  Like I said, downloading the NY Times through Amazon is a Double Plus.  Pass this on."
"I do enjoy reading the Times on my Kindle.It is a little expensive but it's my one major indulgence, Kindle-wise.I can carry my Kindle around and snatch quick reads of a page or 2, all day and night. (ever since I was a kid in the 1960's, my grandpa, and then my dad, and then I, would always read the Times every morning, on paper)The content is usually fairly well formatted for the Kindle, with occasional exceptions. The graphics are rendered in greyscale and usually you can see basically what's going on there. I always go by the ""Articles List"", and I appreciate having summaries of each article there.I wish that some more of the online-only content would be included (but I guess they sell their blogs separately, for Kindle subscriptions). And a few sections are uninteresting to me (Sports, etc.) so I wish I could ""skip this section"" while still in the ""Articles List"" (you can skip a section but only in the ""Sections List"", except then you lose your place in the ""Articles list"")."
"The NY times is great to read.  It's a little expensive, in my opinion for an e-reader version so I don't buy it often.  But when I do, I enjoy reading this news paper."
"I have not received one of my fourteen free copy of the NYT so please end my non subscription at this time, meaning I'm not agreeable to any charges being placed against my account for NYT.  Thank you.  Douglas"

"I periodically buy a paper copy to enjoy over a cup of coffee.  The E-book edition is convenient whenever I have a few minutes to spare and no available coffee shop.  My only other comment; when buying a hard copy one day, the E-book edition the next day may include some duplicate stories."
There are many ways to get the news these days. In fact it barrages you through all the media all day long. But I choose to read the New York Times on my Kindle to get the facts and opinions. It's like an anchor in a storm.
"The NY Times in Kindle format is great!  The majority of the paper is there each day and it's easy to navigate and read.  The print portion of articles is good, but the quality of the limited number of pictures or other rare graphics could be better.  Sometimes there's an article missing one day; then it pops up in the next day's issue.  That's acceptable to me because I know at some point the day's edition has to be closed and distributed.  What I really like is not having the annoying distraction of ads.  Considering the excellent content, the cost isn't that bad at ~$0.67/day.12/26/2010 update: After two months I've canceled the subscription.  I would subscribe again if the cost was $10/month but at $20/month it is too expensive for a digital edition of the paper."
I am particularly partial to the &#34;Book Review&#34; section.  I read the KINDLEedition so I'm not awash in newspaper advertising etc.  It gets me up tospeed on the news... at least what they want to tell us... on a weekly basis.
"With a life of one day it is very difficult to rate a newspaper  - they are read for news and other items and serve an extremely practical purpose.  The New York Times has a good reputation and that stands  and whilst in the USA it is a good daily read with interesting articles, news items etc.  If it wasn't up to standard, it would fade away very quickly so &#34;reviewing it&#34; is a little unnecessary.  Enjoy the paper, read it for leisure and information and be thankful you don't live in a nation without such information readily available and virtually free."
"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period."
Just an awesome kilndle paper. The content cannot be beaten. Great writing and all around coverage of the news. Just way too costly at $20.00 per month. $5 more than the next costliest paper. I wanted to continue my subscription but there are way too many other papers out there from $6 to $10 per month. Would give it 5 stars but for the cost.
